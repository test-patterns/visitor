Sample problem featuring the visitor pattern.

# Class problem
There has been a surcharge in pizza ingredients (sauce, cheese & dough) this past month but now we are finally seeing the prices drop. Implement the visitor design pattern to show a 50% drop in ingredient prices from original prices.

# Desired output

```
Sauce item: Price with Surcharge
2.36
Cheese item: Price with Surcharge
3.9000000000000004
Dough item: Price with Surcharge
5.8

Sauce item: Price with Price-drop
1.00
Cheese item: Price with Price-drop
1.50
Dough item: Price with Price-drop
